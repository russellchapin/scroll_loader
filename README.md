# scroll_loader.js

Scroll-triggered content hopper.

Targets the height of the page and injects Google DFP ads, articles or whatever dynamic content you'd like using AJAX until the sum height of the content is larger than the page.

Content loads when user scrolls past threshold div and iterates based off of an arbitrary interval. 

This is done in an effort to remove pagination from U-T San Diego stories, but maintain advertising impression volume.

REQUIRES JQUERY
